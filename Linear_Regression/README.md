## Brief Description
Linear Regression is a Machine Learning Algorithm which is used to predict some y values based on a
set of x values. The end product of a regression model is an equation that you can use to predict the y-value of an x-value.
Note that you don't know the y-value in advance.

## Jupyter Notebook
In our <a href= "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Dipto9999/ML-Introduction/blob/master/Linear_Regression/linear_regression.ipynb">Notebook</a>, we are working with a Dataset of housing data and attempt to predict housing prices.

### Dataset
The Dataset contains a number of features which are randomly generated. It is <a href = "https://nickmccullum.com/files/Housing_Data.csv">downloaded</a> from Nick McCullum's <a href= "https://nickmccullum.com">Website</a>.
These include:
<ul>
    <li>Average Income in the Area of the House</li>
    <li>Average Number of Total Rooms in the Area</li>
    <li>Price the House is Sold For</li>
    <li>Address of the House</li>
</ul>

### Coefficients
These quantify the impact of the value of the specified variable on the predicted variable. It makes the assumption that
all other variables are held constant. (i.e. Coefficient 15 for Area Population means that a 1-unit increase in the variable
will result in a 15-unit increase in the predicted variable Price.)
