## Brief Description
Given access to FreeCodeCamp Website Resources, I have touched up on some fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms.
I installed the <b>Anaconda</b> Data Science Platform to implement some basic <b>Python scikit-learn</b> library
functionalities in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>.

### Import Statements
All the Machine Learning Algorithms covered in this Introduction import the following open-source libraries.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

```python
# Import Library for Working with Tabular Data
import pandas as pd
# Import Library for Numerical Computing
import numpy as np
# Import Library for Data Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Import Another Library for Data Visualizations
# This makes it easier to create beautiful data visualizations using matplotlib.
import seaborn as sns

# matplotlib visualizations will embed themselves
# directly in our Jupyter Notebook. This will make them easier to
# access and interpret.
%matplotlib inline
```

### PDF Report

We are able to generate a PDF Report of the Jupyter Notebook using the following command.

```
jupyter nbconvert ---to webpdf <filename>.ipynb

```

These can be found in the Algorithm directories
